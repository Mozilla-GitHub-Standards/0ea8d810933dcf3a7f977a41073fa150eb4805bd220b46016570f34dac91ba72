## Preparing and Conducting Interviews With Peers

### Invitation & Setting The Stage

Reach out via email to each person who is participating in the peer review. Ideally send them
a note ~1 week prior to scheduling the meeting. Include some basic information and give them advanced warning of the questions you will be asking. An example email is below:

```
	Hi, shortly you will receive a meeting invite to help me gather feedback for {Person}. 
	This is peer feedback and is something we do periodically to inform how folks are doing.
	
	This is a relatively casual conversation but there are a few questions I would like you 
	to think about prior to our meeting:
	
	1. What areas of largest impact did {Person} have on our projects, the team or the organization?
	
	2. What do you think are {Person's} key strengths?
	
	3. What could {Person} improve?

```

If they employee called out specific areas of interest or if your self assessment had any flags, feel free to include requests for feedback on these specific items. After the email is sent schedule a 45 minute meeting (ideally a few days later).

### Performing Peer Review

When performing the actual peer review keep the following in mind:

- Set the stage, make sure to reiterate the purpose of peer review.
- Make sure to mention that feedback is anonymous.
- Make sure to mention you will be taking notes (you need to take notes).
- Mention you will look for common themes and discuss those with the person.
- Mention that you will spend most of the time listening.. and you should do that.
- Identify and focus on key points & observations - note and evaluate justifications and caveats.
