## Self & Manager Assessment

After deciding to perform a peer review cycle the first step is the _self & manager assessment_. In this phase both you and the employee independently answer a set of questions. The employee also nominates ~3 people to include in the peer review process.

The purpose of this phase is to understand how the employee views their own performance and to compare that view with your own. Note that your review should remain confidential, use both responses to see if you are generally on the same page or if there is a mismatch that should be looked into.

The self & manager assessment consists of the following questions that should be answered via google doc or an email:

1. What areas of largest impact did you have on your projects, your team or the organization?
2. What are your key strengths?
3. What could you improve?
4. Quick Self Assessment Rating: Unsatisfactory, Needs Improvement, Meets Expectations, Exceeds Expectations, Truly Exceptional

Take nominees with a grain of salt and feel free to suggest changes or additions. Make sure to ask yourself, "is it appropriate to ask this nominee to comment on this person's performance?"
