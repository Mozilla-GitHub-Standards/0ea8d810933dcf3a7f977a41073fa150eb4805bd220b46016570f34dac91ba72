# Performance Peer Review @Mozmeao

The purpose of performance peer review (not to be confused with code review) @mozmeao is to give meaningful feedback to employees outside of quarterly or yearly reviews. Peer review is particularly good at providing feedback on team interaction and can surface disconnects between how the employee views their performance and their actual performance.

While peer review can be conducted at any time, some particularly good times are:

* 6 months after a new hire.
* After completion of a large project.
* Preparing/evaluating a promotion or a performance improvement plan.
* Whenever someone requests it.

The process relies on 1:1 interaction over requesting via feedback over email or via a form. 

The basic steps are outlined below:

1. [Self & Manager Assessment](self_manager_assessment.md)
2. [Preparing and Conducting Interviews With Peers](conduct_peer_review.md)
3. [Evaluation of Responses](evaluate_responses.md)
4. [valuation of Responses](employee_review.md)
