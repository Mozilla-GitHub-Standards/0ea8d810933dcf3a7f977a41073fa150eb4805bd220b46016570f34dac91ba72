## Evaluation of Responses

After completing the reviews it's time to analyze and process your notes and prepare for the discussion with the employee.

Some basic hints:

- Keep in mind that this feedback is incredibly subjective, you must use your judgement when deciding what feedback is passed on.
- Look for themes, things that were mentioned by more than one person.
- Look for disconnects, where the person's self assessment differs from the peer review.
- Collate any feedback related to specific items.
- Write up a summary, be as specific as possible both for things to keep doing and things to tweak or change.
